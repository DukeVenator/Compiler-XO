# XenOrchestraInstallerUpdater - Install / Update Xen-Orchestra from sources

# In a nutshell

This repo consist of script to install and update [Xen Orchestra](https://xen-orchestra.com/#!/) for CentOS 7/Ubuntu 18/Debian 9

Installation is done using latest xo-server and xo-web sources by default. With this method Xen-Orchestra has all features unlocked which are normally available only with monthly fee.

Optional plugins can be installed. They are included in XO repository, but not installed by default. Check list from [Xen Orchestra plugins](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/tree/master/packages) and edit xo-install.cfg accordingly.

Xen-Orchestra is a great project and i strongly encourage you to consider the supported version of their product.

Paid version comes with pro support and appliance and is the suggested option for larger environments. Method that this script offers comes with no support and is not the officially recommended way of using Xen-Orchestra. This is mainly intended for testing purposes and small environments which don't require support.


# Instructions

### script
Clone this repository, copy sample.xo-install.cfg as xo-install.cfg and edit variables to suit your preferences and run xo-install.sh as root. Sample configuration will be copied as xo-install.cfg
 if doesn't exist
```
basic functionality including menu:
./xo-install.sh

non-interactive update task (option 2):
./xo-install.sh --update

non-interactive install task (option 1):
./xo-install.sh --install

quick option to rollback (option 4):
./xo-install.sh --rollback
```

Tool makes some checks and offers options:

1. Autoinstall
 - Installs all dependencies (necessary packages and Xen-Orchestra itself). Doesn't do firewall changes, so make sure you allow access to port specified in xo-install.cfg.
 - Packages listed in the end of this README

2. Update / Install without dependencies
 - Updates NodeJS and Yarn packages if AUTOUPDATE variable is set to true (it is by default)
 - Installs Xen-Orchestra from latest sources (doesn't install any new packages)

3. Deploy container
 - Offers options to pull ready docker image from dockerhub, also maintained by me

4. Rollback installation
 - Offers option to choose which installation to use from existing ones (if more than 1)

notes:

 - If you choose to install with option 2, you need to take care that required packages are already installed
 - You can change xo-server and xo-web git branch/tag by editing xo-install.cfg $BRANCH variable

## Notes

Tool has been tested to work with following distros:

- CentOS 7 (note LVM file level restore issue from below)
- Debian 9
- Ubuntu 18.04

Installation works but not tested frequently:
- Debian 8
- Ubuntu 16.04

In order to use file level restore from delta backups, the service needs to be ran as root.
CentOS installation is currently not able to do file level restore if the backed up disk contains LVM.

CentOS setup is confirmed to work with fresh minimal installation and SELinux enabled.
Although script doesn't do any SELinux checks or modifications, so you need to take care of possible changes by yourself according to your system.

Tool makes all necessary changes required for Xen-Orchestra to run (including packages, user creation, permissions). Please evaluate script if needed.
I take no responsibility of possible damage caused by this tool.
